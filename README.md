# Dynamic-Network-Visualization

This repository contains the source code for my **Bachelor Project** at **TU Wien**.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Oli2406/Dynamic-Network-Visualization.git
cd Dynamic-Network-Visualization/frontend
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**
Make sure you have **Node.js** (v20.18.0) installed. Then, install the required dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

#### ⚠️ Note
- You need to be inside the `frontend/` directory before running any Angular commands.  
- The Angular CLI (`ng`) must be installed globally for `ng serve` to work:
  ```sh
  npm install -g @angular/cli
  ```
- Alternatively, you can use the included npm script (no global Angular installation required):
  ```sh
  npm start
  ```

### **3. Run the Development Server**
Start the Angular application with one of the following:

```sh
# Using global Angular CLI
ng serve

# OR using the npm script
npm start
```

The application will be available at:
```
http://localhost:4200/
```

### **4. Pick a Year**
The dataset contains ~35,000 works of art exhibited at the **Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)**.  
Pick a year between **1929 and 1989** to see a visualized network of exhibitions and artists for that year.
